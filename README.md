# PYVTE

Python Virtual Testing Environment
The goal of this project is to allow python programs to be tested by a custom, locked-down interpreter. This allows for the theoretical conatinment of untrusted code, which can be used in application such as autograders for programming assignmetns.

## This is a work in progress
Only the very basics work right now due to pythons complex syntactic nature.
